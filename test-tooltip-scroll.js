GL ACCOUNTS "OTHERS" TOOLTIP - SCROLLABLE ENHANCEMENT TEST GUIDE
=================================================================

The GL accounts chart's "Others" column tooltip has been enhanced to be scrollable
when it contains many items.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
----------------------
1. Location: Dashboard.tsx (lines 3900-4025)
2. CSS Styles: index.css (lines 172-237)

KEY FEATURES:
-------------
✅ Automatic scroll detection: Scrollbar appears when > 5 GL accounts
✅ Fixed header: Shows "Others - N GL Accounts" and total percentage
✅ Scrollable content area: Max height of 320px
✅ Fixed footer: Shows quarter average
✅ PROCEED brand styling: Gradient scrollbar in brand colors
✅ Hover effects: Items highlight on hover
✅ Visual indicator: "(scroll for more)" text when scrollable

BEHAVIOR:
---------
• Short lists (≤ 5 items): Display normally without scroll
• Long lists (> 5 items):
  - Scrollable area with max height of 320px
  - Thin scrollbar styled with PROCEED colors (gradient from primary to accent)
  - Smooth scrolling with hover effects on items
  - Header and footer remain visible while scrolling

STYLING:
--------
• Scrollbar width: 8px (thin and unobtrusive)
• Scrollbar colors: Gradient from #9e1f63 (primary) to #e05e3d (accent)
• Hover effect: Gradient reverses and adds subtle shadow
• Item hover: Light gray background (#f8f8f8)
• Firefox support: Uses native thin scrollbar with brand colors

TESTING:
--------
To test the implementation:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Upload an Excel file with cost data
3. Look at the GL Accounts chart
4. Hover over the "Others" column (if present)
5. If there are > 5 GL accounts in Others, you should see:
   - A scrollable list with a styled scrollbar
   - Fixed header showing total and percentage
   - Individual items with hover effects
   - Fixed footer with quarter average

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
------------------
• Tooltip width: Min 350px for readability
• Max height: 500px total (including header/footer)
• Scrollable area: 320px max height
• Works across all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

ACCESSIBILITY:
--------------
• Scrollbar is keyboard navigable
• High contrast between scrollbar and background
• Clear visual indicators for scrollable content
• Tooltips for truncated GL account names
